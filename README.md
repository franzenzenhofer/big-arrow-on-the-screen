# Let your AI agents paint big arrows, boxes and text on your screen

**big-arrow-on-the-screen** (`bigarrow`) is a macOS command-line tool, plus a skill for Claude Code and Codex, that draws an arrow and a sign on top of every window. Clicks go through, your keyboard focus stays put, and the arrow removes itself. MIT licensed.

> Your AI agent can refactor a monorepo, write a migration and explain monads, but when it needs you to click one button it prints *"please click Allow in the dialog"* into a terminal you are not looking at. `bigarrow` gives it a finger.

![bigarrow pointing at a dialog's Allow button](docs/images/demo.gif)

```bash
bigarrow point --element "Allow" --app "System Settings" --text "Franz, click Allow: Ghostty may control your Mac"
```

One transparent window above everything, on every display and every Space. Drawing needs **no macOS permission at all**. One Swift binary: no daemon, no menu-bar icon, no account, no telemetry, and, we checked twice, no AI inside. It is an arrow.

## Real apps, real use cases

Real apps on a real Mac (macOS 27), the real `bigarrow`, staged by `scripts/real-scenes.sh`.

### macOS Desktop & Dock: stop "click wallpaper to show desktop"

![An agent walks a human through the most complained-about Mac setting since 2023: one click on the wallpaper and every window flees; then 1. The apple. Yes, the fruit. 2. System Settings. Where settings go to hide. 3. Desktop & Dock. Not Wallpaper. Not Displays. This one. 4. Scroll. Further. It's always further. 5. 'Show desktop'. Nothing to do with Stage Manager. 6. 'Only in Stage Manager' means 'off'. Obviously. Then the wallpaper click: Nothing happens. Bliss.](docs/images/real/wallpaper.gif)

["The most annoying change in Mac update history"](https://www.imore.com/mac/macos/macos-sonoma-click-to-reveal-desktop-turn-off), fixed in six arrows ([MP4](docs/videos/wallpaper.mp4)).

### System Settings: grant a permission

![System Settings, Device Control and Data Access: a green arrow with a close button, Franz, switch this on: Terminal may control your Mac, and an orange zigzag ring on the plus button: Not in the list? Plus. Then find it.](docs/images/real/settings.png)

```bash
open "x-apple.systempreferences:com.apple.preference.security?Privacy_Accessibility"
bigarrow start --element Terminal_Toggle --app "System Settings" \
  --text "Franz, switch this on: Terminal may control your Mac" --from right --color green --close-button
bigarrow start --element Add --role button --app "System Settings" \
  --text "Not in the list? Plus. Then find it." --from bottom-right --style ring --color orange --shape zigzag --size S
```

### Keynote: a three-step how-to

![Keynote: a purple ring, 1. Click Animate; an orange box, 2. Add an Effect; a teal zigzag on Play, 3. Press play. Bask in the applause.](docs/images/real/keynote.png)

```bash
bigarrow start --element Animate --app Keynote --role radiobutton --text "1. Click Animate" --from right \
  --style ring --color purple
bigarrow start --element "Add an Effect" --app Keynote --text "2. Add an Effect" --from right \
  --style box --corners sharp --color "#FF9F0A" --shape straight
bigarrow start --element Play --app Keynote --role button --text "3. Press play. Bask in the applause." \
  --from top --color teal --shape zigzag --size S
```

### Print dialog: helping Mom save a PDF

![TextEdit print dialog: a pink arrow, Mom, click PDF, then Save as PDF, and a small black one on Cancel: Not this one, Mom](docs/images/real/print.png)

```bash
bigarrow start --element PDF --role button --app TextEdit \
  --text "Mom, click PDF, then Save as PDF" --from bottom --color pink --border white-black
bigarrow start --element Cancel --role button --app TextEdit \
  --text "Not this one, Mom" --from bottom-right --color black --size S
```

### Chrome: the right tab out of 14

![Chrome, three windows, 14 tabs, a big indigo sign: It's this tab, not the other 13](docs/images/real/chrome.png)

```bash
bigarrow start --app "Google Chrome:Sourdough" --element "Sourdough - Wikipedia" --role radiobutton \
  --text "It's this tab, not the other 13" --from top --shape zigzag --color "#5856D6" --size L
```

`--app "App:tab title"` raises the window and selects the tab first.

### Finder: "no, the other grid icon"

![Finder: a black ring on the icon view button, Not this one, and a green box on the Group button: No, the other grid icon. This one.](docs/images/real/finder.png)

```bash
bigarrow start --element "icon view" --role radiobutton --app Finder \
  --text "Not this one" --from top-left --style ring --color black --size S
bigarrow start --element Group --role menubutton --app Finder \
  --text "No, the other grid icon. This one." --from top --style box --color green
```

### A real guide: allow screen recording

<a href="docs/guides/allow-screen-recording/how-to-allow-screen-recording-on-a-mac.pdf"><img src="docs/images/guide-pdf-preview.png" width="600" alt="The guide as a 6-page PDF: page thumbnails on the left, page 1 large on the right, How to allow screen recording on a Mac, step 1 with an arrow at Privacy &amp; Security"></a>

The whole guide as a 6-page PDF, every screenshot an arrow an agent drew. [Download the PDF](docs/guides/allow-screen-recording/how-to-allow-screen-recording-on-a-mac.pdf) or [read it here](docs/guides/allow-screen-recording/README.md).

## Copy buttons: copy, then paste

Sometimes the human has to paste something: a command the agent may not run, a URL, a code. Put it in the sign between `{{` and `}}` and it gets a copy button. One click copies it, the icon turns into a check, and the arrow stays where the value goes.

### Terminal: a sudo command the agent must not type

**Before the click:** the command on a copy button, the arrow at the prompt.

![Terminal, a failed xcodebuild: You have not agreed to the Xcode license agreements, admin privileges required. A blue arrow with a yellow border at the empty prompt line: Franz, Xcode needs your password once. Copy [sudo xcodebuild -license accept, copy icon] paste it here, press Return.](docs/images/real/copy-terminal.png)

**Just copied:** the icon turns into a check, Cmd-V has pasted the command, the arrow is still there.

![The same Terminal and arrow a moment later: the chip shows a check instead of the copy icon, and sudo xcodebuild -license accept is pasted at the prompt.](docs/images/real/copy-terminal-copied.png)

```bash
bigarrow start --rect 424,386,420,20 --app "Terminal:my-app" --from bottom \
  --color blue --border-color yellow --text-color yellow \
  --text "Franz, Xcode needs your password once. Copy {{sudo xcodebuild -license accept}} paste it here, press Return"
```

The agent never sees the password, and the human never retypes a command.

### Chrome: open the preview

![Chrome, a blue bent arrow with a yellow border and yellow text at the address bar: Preview is up: paste http://localhost:5173 here, the URL on a yellow copy button](docs/images/real/copy-address.png)

```bash
bigarrow start --element "Address and search bar" --app "Google Chrome" --from bottom-right --size S \
  --color blue --border-color yellow --text-color yellow \
  --text "Preview is up: paste {{http://localhost:5173}} here"
```

The chip takes the sign's text colour, so a yellow-on-blue sign gets a yellow button with the URL in blue.

- Several values per sign work: `"User {{franz}}, password {{correct horse}}"`. A value wider than the sign is shortened in the middle on screen; the whole value is copied.
- A click on the chip copies and keeps the arrow; a click anywhere else on the sign or the shaft still removes it. No permission: the clipboard needs none.
- `--json` gives every chip's frame (`copyButtons`, global top-left points) and, when the arrow ends, how often it was copied (`copied`). `--say` reads the sentence without the braces.
- The copy and check icons are [Feather](https://feathericons.com)'s (MIT), see [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).

## What is this actually for?

Fair question. Arrows have existed since roughly the Paleolithic. What changed: agents now do real work on your Mac, and sooner or later hit a step **only a human may do**, or one the human wants to learn.

- **"Click Allow."** Permission prompts, OAuth consent, "Open with...?". The agent finds the button but must not, or cannot, press it. It can point.
- **"Your turn."** 2FA, CAPTCHAs, passkeys, payments, signatures. It points, you decide, it continues.
- **"Paste this."** A `sudo` command, a URL, a code: on the sign with a [copy button](#copy-buttons-copy-then-paste), the arrow on where it goes.
- **"I need you, and you're making coffee."** `--say` reads the sign aloud. Your Mac will literally call you back to your desk.
- **"Show me how."** Ask how to do something in Blender, and the agent points at each control in turn. A product tour, minus the product.
- **Helping someone else.** On a parent's Mac or over a screen share, pointing beats "the button at the top, no, the other top".
- **Demos and docs.** Highlight while recording, or render straight to a PNG with `--png`.
- **Debugging coordinates.** Point at your Accessibility or Peekaboo coordinates and look. `--dry-run --json` says where it *would* point.

Not a screen annotator, not a click bot, not a screenshot tool. It never clicks, types or captures. It only points. Deliberately.

## Install

```bash
brew install franzenzenhofer/tap/bigarrow
bigarrow install-skill          # teaches Claude Code (~/.claude/skills) and Codex (~/.agents/skills)
```

From source: `swift build -c release` (Xcode 16+, macOS 14+), binary at `.build/release/bigarrow`. The binary is pure Swift; `scripts/` only records screenshots and runs tests.

## The three commands an agent needs

```bash
bigarrow point --element "Allow" --app "System Settings" --text "Franz, click Allow"   # by label
bigarrow point --at 760,500 --text "Franz, click HERE"                                 # by coordinate
bigarrow start --window "Safari:Inbox" --text "This window" && bigarrow stop            # until stopped
```

Every arrow ends by itself. Nobody has to clean up after an agent that forgot:

| | |
|---|---|
| Time limit | `--duration 10` (`point` 8 s, `start` 300 s, `0` = no limit) |
| Start and stop | `start` returns at once; `stop` (or `stop --all`) removes it |
| The agent goes away | the arrow ends with the agent process that drew it (`CLAUDE_PID` or `BIGARROW_OWNER_PID`) |
| The human answers | `bigarrow stop --hook` as a Claude Code `UserPromptSubmit` hook clears that session's arrows |
| The human closes it | `--close-button` (opt-in) |

Targets: `--at X,Y`, `--rect X,Y,W,H`, `--mouse`, `--window App[:title]`, `--element Label --app App`, `--peekaboo ID --snapshot see.json`. Coordinates are global top-left logical points, as Accessibility and Peekaboo report them; `--display N` makes them relative to one display.

`--app App[:window or tab title]` (or `--window`) first brings that app, window or Chrome/Safari tab to the front, because pointing at a window hidden behind your terminal is a special kind of unhelpful. If another app covers the target later, the arrow hides until it is visible again. `--no-raise` opts out. `bigarrow elements --app X` lists what `--element` can match; `bigarrow doctor` shows permissions and displays.

Every command takes `--json`. Exit codes: 0 ok, 2 bad input, 3 target not found, 4 permission missing. Agents love exit codes. Humans tolerate them.

## Looks

It is an arrow, so we spent an unreasonable amount of time on how it looks.

![Big arrows with signs: click here, sign here, over here, you are here, type your name, read this first, no the other one, click Allow](docs/images/hero.png)

![every border style and colour option: default white border with shadow, white-black, black, close button, custom border and text colours](docs/images/looks.png)

Six looks over white, macOS grey, dark, black, red and a busy web page:

![default, white-black, black, close button, custom colours and a black arrow, each over six backgrounds](docs/images/backgrounds.png)

![every style, shape, size and colour](docs/images/gallery.png)

- `--shape bend|straight|zigzag|spiral`: zigzag for when it is *really* urgent; spiral loops once around the sign, for when it must be impossible to miss
- `--style arrow|ring|box` (rings and boxes are outlines, the target stays visible), `--size S|M|L`, `--corners round|sharp`
- `--color red|orange|yellow|green|teal|blue|purple|pink|black|white|#RRGGBB`
- `--border shadow|white-black|black`: white border with drop shadow (default), a thin black edge instead of the shadow, or just a thin black outline
- `--border-color`, `--text-color`, `--edge-color`, `--close-color`, `--close-x-color`; left out, each picks a readable colour
- `{{value}}` in `--text` becomes a [copy button](#copy-buttons-copy-then-paste); `--close-button` puts an X inside the sign's right end; `--follow` moves with a window or element; `--until-click` ends on a click on the target; `--say` speaks the sign
- Several arrows at once keep their signs out of each other's way

`scripts/gallery.py` renders every combination and zooms into every sign-to-shaft joint ([junctions](docs/images/junctions.png)), because a seam at the joint was, apparently, unacceptable.

## Creative arrows

Fake dialogs, real `bigarrow`, clean CI runner (`BACKDROP_ARGS=--cover scripts/funny-scenes.sh`). The dialogs are fake. The feelings are real.

### Delete node_modules: the easiest yes of your life

![Delete node_modules? Yes. Obviously.](docs/images/scenes/node-modules.png)

`--color green`, because some decisions are easy

### Cookie banner: the zigzag of mild urgency

![Cookie banner: Franz, nobody reads these either](docs/images/scenes/cookies.png)

`--shape zigzag --color orange`

### Software update: one lap of honour

![Software update: Twirl. Then click.](docs/images/scenes/spiral.png)

`--shape spiral`: once around the sign, then to the button

### 2FA: find your phone

![2FA: This is where you sigh and find your phone](docs/images/scenes/two-factor.png)

`--color purple`

### Friday deploy: the agent votes Cancel

![Friday deploy: the agent strongly suggests Cancel](docs/images/scenes/agent-needs-you.png)

`--close-button`, because the human gets the last word

### Save: three arrows, one button

![Three arrows, one Save button](docs/images/scenes/which-button.png)

three `start`s, one button, zero ambiguity

### Permissions: Terminal, not bigarrow

![Grant Accessibility to Terminal, not to bigarrow](docs/images/scenes/permissions.png)

`--style box --corners sharp`, plus a lesson about macOS permissions

### Does it need Screen Recording or Accessibility?

**Drawing: no.** Some ways of finding the target do:

| You use | Permission |
|---|---|
| `--at`, `--rect`, `--mouse`, `--window App`, `--peekaboo`, `--app App` | none |
| `--element`, `elements`, `--until-click`, `--app App:title` | Accessibility |
| `--window App:title` (macOS 26 hides window titles) | Screen Recording, plus Accessibility to raise (not with `--no-raise`) |

macOS grants these to the app that started `bigarrow` (Terminal, iTerm2, Ghostty, VS Code, Claude), never to `bigarrow` itself, so switch on that app. `bigarrow doctor` names it; a missing permission exits with code 4 and names the app and the settings pane.

### It never takes the focus. How is it in front?

**On top and focused are two different things on macOS.** The arrow sits at screen-saver level, above windows, dialogs and full-screen apps, but never becomes the active window.

### Will it steal my focus while I'm typing?

**No.** That was the hardest bug in the project: `NSApplication.run()` quietly activates a process without a terminal. `bigarrow` pumps events itself, and the tests check that the frontmost app never changes.

### Can I click through it?

**Yes, everywhere except the sign and the shaft.** A click there removes the arrow (it dims under the pointer to say so). Clicks on the target or near the head go straight to the app, without taking the focus.

### Multiple displays? Full-screen apps? Stage Manager? Spaces?

**Yes, yes, yes, yes.** Negative coordinates included. Unplug a display while an arrow is on it and the arrow politely leaves. See the [verification matrix](docs/verification/multi-display.md).

### How much CPU does a pulsing arrow cost?

**1.4 % on a CI runner.** Core Animation does the work in the render server.

### Does `--element` work inside web pages?

**In Electron apps, yes. In Chrome, only with help.** Chrome needs `--force-renderer-accessibility` (or VoiceOver on); it ignores the usual request (verified October 2026). Chrome's own toolbar always works. Otherwise point at page coordinates, which the skill explains.

### Could an agent use this to trick me?

Say, by covering the Decline button? **Not beyond what it can already do.** An agent that runs shell commands as you can do far worse, so `bigarrow` gives it nothing new. Still, each checked by a test: boxes and rings are outlines, so the target stays visible; the sign keeps clear of the target (or overlaps it as little as possible); a click on sign or shaft removes the arrow; every arrow ends by itself. And the skill makes the sign say what your click does.

### Why a skill? Is that a lot of tokens?

**182 tokens, most of the time.** That is the skill's description, the only part the agent always sees. The instructions, 1,398 tokens (Anthropic's token-count API, Claude Opus 5.5), load only when it decides to point; pane ids and look flags (1,008 more) only when it needs them.

### Why not just use a screen annotation app?

**Those are for humans drawing on screens.** This is for programs pointing at things, from a shell, with exit codes. Twenty-six tools were checked first ([research](docs/research/)). None did this.

### Is it AI?

**No.** It is the least intelligent part of your AI stack, and proud of it.

## How we know it works

- 104 automated tests: geometry, placement, joints, a golden image, copy buttons, recorded window-server, Accessibility and Peekaboo fixtures, and the real window server (click-through, focus never moves, stop timing). CI runs macOS 15; also passed on macOS 26 and 27.
- 18 behaviour checks on a clean runner ([visual.yml](.github/workflows/visual.yml)): clicks on the X, a copy button (the clipboard holds the value, the arrow stays), `--until-click`, `--follow`, raising and `--no-raise`, hiding while covered, Chrome tab selection, owner exit, `stop --hook`, `--say`, full-screen, Stage Manager, Spaces, second and 2x displays, unplugging mid-arrow, CPU.
- A fresh agent given only the skill and "show Franz where the Reload button in Chrome is" found it by label and built the right command ([transcript](docs/skill-tests/2026-10-08-chrome-reload.md)). It also found a bug, which is now a test.

## For agents (and the humans who configure them)

`skill/big-arrow/` (Agent Skills format, plus `agents/openai.yaml` for Codex) teaches the agent when to point, how to pick a target, to write a full sentence on the sign, to `--say` it when you are away, and to `stop` once you acted.

## Plan, decisions, research

`docs/plan/PLAN.md`, `docs/plan/TICKETS.md` (generated from `tickets.json`), `docs/decisions/`, `docs/research/`, `docs/verification/`, `docs/skill-tests/`, `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Prior art and thanks

Peekaboo (https://github.com/openclaw/Peekaboo) and Nameplate (https://github.com/steipete/Nameplate) by Peter Steinberger showed the overlay recipe and the skill packaging. Neither points with a labelled arrow. `bigarrow` reads Peekaboo's `see --json` as a target source.
